# Expo Dev Client Fix - Build Ready ✅

## 🚨 **EXPO DEV CLIENT ERROR IDENTIFIED & FIXED**

### **❌ The Problem:**
```
You want to build a development client build for platforms: Android
However, we detected that you don't have expo-dev-client installed for your project.
You'll need to install expo-dev-client manually.
Failed to resolve plugin for module "expo-dev-client"
```

### **🔧 ROOT CAUSE:**
- **Missing Dependencies**: `expo-dev-client` is not properly installed
- **Plugin Resolution**: EAS build can't resolve the expo-dev-client plugin
- **Dependency Installation**: Dependencies need to be installed with legacy peer deps

### **✅ COMPLETE FIX APPLIED:**

## **1. Install Dependencies with Legacy Peer Deps** ✅
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## **2. Verify expo-dev-client Installation** ✅
```bash
npm list expo-dev-client
```

## **3. Clear Cache and Reinstall** ✅
```bash
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## **4. Update app.json Configuration** ✅
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      "expo-dev-client",
      "expo-router",
      "expo-build-properties"
    ]
  }
}
```
