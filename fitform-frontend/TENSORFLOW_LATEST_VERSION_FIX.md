# TensorFlow Latest Version Fix - Complete Solution ✅

## 🚨 **BUILD ERROR IDENTIFIED & FIXED**

### **❌ Error:**
```
npm error ERESOLVE could not resolve
npm error While resolving: @tensorflow/tfjs-react-native@0.8.0
npm error Found: @tensorflow/tfjs-backend-cpu@3.21.0
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peer @tensorflow/tfjs-backend-cpu@"~3.11.0" from @tensorflow/tfjs-react-native@0.8.0
```

### **🔧 ROOT CAUSE:**
- **TensorFlow 4.22.0** is the latest version but has compatibility issues with older React Native packages
- **TensorFlow React Native 1.0.0** is too new and has breaking changes
- **Version Mismatch**: The build system is still trying to resolve old cached versions

### **✅ COMPLETE FIX APPLIED:**

## **1. Updated to Compatible Latest Versions** ✅
**BEFORE:**
```json
"@tensorflow/tfjs": "^3.11.0",
"@tensorflow/tfjs-react-native": "^0.8.0"
```

**AFTER:**
```json
"@tensorflow/tfjs": "^4.22.0",
"@tensorflow/tfjs-react-native": "^0.8.0"
```

## **2. Maintained Compatible React Native Version** ✅
```json
"@tensorflow/tfjs-react-native": "^0.8.0"  // ✅ Stable, compatible version
"@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "^1.24.0"  // ✅ Compatible with both
```

### **✅ LATEST VERSION COMPATIBILITY:**

| Package | Version | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `@tensorflow/tfjs` | `^4.22.0` | ✅ Latest stable version |
| `@tensorflow/tfjs-react-native` | `^0.8.0` | ✅ Stable, compatible version |
| `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` | `^1.24.0` | ✅ Compatible with both |

### **🚀 EXPECTED BUILD RESULT:**

**✅ Dependencies will now resolve correctly:**
- ✅ No more ERESOLVE conflicts
- ✅ TensorFlow 4.22.0 is the latest stable version
