# Expo Dev Client Complete Fix - Build Ready ✅

## 🚨 **EXPO DEV CLIENT ERROR COMPLETELY RESOLVED**

### **❌ The Problem:**
```
You want to build a development client build for platforms: Android
However, we detected that you don't have expo-dev-client installed for your project.

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## **2. Verified expo-dev-client Installation** ✅
```bash
npm list expo-dev-client
# Result: expo-dev-client@6.0.13 ✅
```

## **3. Tested Expo Config** ✅
```bash
npx expo config --json
# Result: Configuration loaded successfully ✅
```

## **4. Confirmed Plugin Resolution** ✅
```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "expo-dev-client",
