# Receipt Generation Functionality

## Overview
This document describes the receipt generation functionality implemented for the FitForm Tailoring application. Receipts are automatically generated for completed transactions (picked-up purchases and picked-up/returned rentals).

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Receipt Generation
- **ReceiptController**: Handles receipt generation for both rentals and purchases
- **PDF Generation**: Uses DomPDF library for professional receipt generation
- **Receipt Templates**: Custom HTML templates with professional styling
- **Tailor Information**: Includes "Cristelle Mae D. Na√±ez" as the tailor signature

### 2. Frontend Integration
- **Receipt Buttons**: Added to order details modal for eligible transactions
- **Download Functionality**: Direct PDF download via browser
- **Status-based Display**: Receipt buttons only appear for completed transactions

### 3. Receipt Content
- **Business Header**: FitForm Tailoring branding
- **Transaction Details**: Order ID, customer info, item details
- **Financial Information**: Amounts, penalties (for rentals), totals
- **Professional Styling**: Clean, professional receipt design

## Error Handling

### Backend Validation:
- Checks transaction status before generating receipt
