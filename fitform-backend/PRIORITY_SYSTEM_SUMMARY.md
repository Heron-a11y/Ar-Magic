# First-Come-First-Served Priority System

## Overview

The auto-approval system now implements a **first-come-first-served priority system** that ensures fair appointment booking based on creation timestamps.

## How It Works

### 1. **Priority Determination**
- When multiple appointments are created for the same time slot (within 15 minutes)
- The system compares `created_at` timestamps
- **First appointment created = Priority**
- **Later appointments = Auto-cancelled**

### 2. **Conflict Resolution Process**

```
Appointment A (10:00 AM) - Created at 09:00:00
Appointment B (10:00 AM) - Created at 09:05:00
Appointment C (10:00 AM) - Created at 09:10:00

Result:
✅ Appointment A → CONFIRMED (first created)
❌ Appointment B → CANCELLED (conflict with A)
❌ Appointment C → CANCELLED (conflict with A)
```

### 3. **System Flow**

1. **New appointment created** → Status: `pending`
2. **Check business hours** → Skip if outside hours
3. **Find time slot conflicts** → Get all appointments within 15 minutes
4. **Compare creation times**:
   - If this appointment is **earlier** → Cancel conflicting ones, approve this one
   - If this appointment is **later** → Cancel this one, keep earlier ones
5. **Check daily limit** → Skip if limit reached
6. **Auto-approve** → Status: `confirmed`

## Logging

### Priority Approval
```
Appointment auto-approved with first-come-first-served priority
- appointment_id: 123
- user_id: 456
- created_at: 2025-10-14 09:00:00
```

### Auto-Cancellation (Later Appointment)
```
Appointment auto-cancelled: Time slot conflict (first-come-first-served)
- appointment_id: 124
- reason: Time slot already taken by earlier appointment
- earliest_conflict_created_at: 2025-10-14 09:00:00
```

### Auto-Cancellation (Conflicting Appointments)
```
Conflicting appointment auto-cancelled: First-come-first-served priority
- cancelled_appointment_id: 125
- priority_appointment_id: 123
- reason: Time slot taken by earlier appointment
```

## Frontend Updates

The admin interface now shows:
- ✅ **"First-come-first-served priority for time slots"**
- ✅ **"Later appointments automatically cancelled if time slot taken"**

## Testing

### Manual Test
```bash
php test-priority-system.php
```

### Scenario Testing
1. **Create multiple appointments** for the same time slot
2. **Check timestamps** in the database
3. **Verify priority** - first created should be confirmed
4. **Verify cancellations** - later ones should be cancelled

## Benefits

1. **Fair System**: Based on creation time, not admin bias
2. **Automatic Resolution**: No manual intervention needed
3. **Clear Logging**: Full audit trail of decisions
4. **User Experience**: First person gets the slot they want
5. **Admin Efficiency**: Reduces manual conflict resolution

## Edge Cases Handled

- **Simultaneous bookings**: Database timestamps provide microsecond precision
- **Multiple conflicts**: All later appointments are cancelled
- **Business hours**: Priority only applies within business hours
- **Daily limits**: Priority system respects appointment limits
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with detailed logging

## Database Impact

- **No schema changes** required
- **Uses existing** `created_at` and `status` fields
- **Maintains data integrity** with proper transaction handling
- **Preserves audit trail** with comprehensive logging
