# Sizing Standards Management Guide

## üîç **Problem: Cannot Delete Sizing Standards**

### **Root Cause**
The error `#1451 - Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails` occurs because:

1. **Foreign Key Constraint**: The `size_recommendations` table has a foreign key that references `sizing_standards.id`
2. **Dependent Records**: There are existing size recommendations that depend on the sizing standard you're trying to delete
3. **Database Integrity**: MySQL prevents deletion to maintain data consistency

### **Error Message Breakdown**
```
#1451 - Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails 
('priva'.'size_recommendations', CONSTRAINT 'size_recommendations_sizing_standard_id_foreign' 
FOREIGN KEY ('sizing_standard_id') REFERENCES 'sizing_standards' ('id'))
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Solutions Implemented**

### **1. Safe Delete Method (Recommended)**
- **API Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/admin/sizing/standards/{id}`
- **What it does**: Automatically deletes dependent size recommendations first, then deletes the sizing standard
- **Safety**: Maintains database integrity while allowing deletion

### **2. Soft Delete (Best Practice)**
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/admin/sizing/standards/{id}/deactivate`
- **What it does**: Marks the sizing standard as inactive instead of deleting it
- **Benefits**: 
  - No data loss
  - Can be reactivated later
  - Maintains referential integrity
  - Better for audit trails

### **3. Deletion Check**
- **API Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/sizing/standards/{id}/check-deletion`
- **What it does**: Checks if a sizing standard can be safely deleted
- **Returns**: Information about dependent records and warnings

## üì± **Frontend API Methods**

```javascript
// Check if deletion is safe
const deletionCheck = await apiService.checkSizingStandardDeletion(standardId);

// Safe deletion (removes dependent records first)
await apiService.deleteSizingStandard(standardId);

// Soft delete (mark as inactive)
await apiService.deactivateSizingStandard(standardId);

// Reactivate (mark as active again)
await apiService.reactivateSizingStandard(standardId);

// Get all standards (including inactive)
const allStandards = await apiService.getAllSizingStandards();

// Get only active standards
const activeStandards = await apiService.getActiveSizingStandards();
```

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Cleanup Script**

### **Manual Cleanup Script**
Located at: `database/cleanup_sizing_standards.php`

**Usage:**
```bash
cd fitform-backend
php database/cleanup_sizing_standards.php
```

**What it does:**
1. Shows current sizing standards and their dependent records
2. Asks for confirmation before proceeding
3. Safely deletes dependent records first
4. Then deletes the sizing standards
5. Provides cleanup verification

## üîß **Manual Database Cleanup (Advanced Users)**

### **Option 1: Delete Dependent Records First**
```sql
-- Check for dependent records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM size_recommendations WHERE sizing_standard_id = [STANDARD_ID];

-- Delete dependent records first
DELETE FROM size_recommendations WHERE sizing_standard_id = [STANDARD_ID];

-- Now delete the sizing standard
DELETE FROM sizing_standards WHERE id = [STANDARD_ID];
```

### **Option 2: Use CASCADE DELETE (Modify Schema)**
```sql
-- Drop existing foreign key
ALTER TABLE size_recommendations 
DROP FOREIGN KEY size_recommendations_sizing_standard_id_foreign;

-- Recreate with CASCADE DELETE
ALTER TABLE size_recommendations 
ADD CONSTRAINT size_recommendations_sizing_standard_id_foreign 
FOREIGN KEY (sizing_standard_id) 
REFERENCES sizing_standards(id) 
ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: CASCADE DELETE will automatically delete all dependent records when you delete a sizing standard.

## üìä **API Endpoints Summary**

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/admin/sizing/standards` | Get active sizing standards |
| `GET` | `/admin/sizing/standards/all` | Get all standards (active + inactive) |
| `GET` | `/admin/sizing/standards/active` | Get only active standards |
| `GET` | `/admin/sizing/standards/{id}/check-deletion` | Check deletion safety |
| `POST` | `/admin/sizing/standards` | Create/update standard |
| `PUT` | `/admin/sizing/standards/{id}/parameters` | Customize parameters |
| `DELETE` | `/admin/sizing/standards/{id}` | Safe delete (removes dependents) |
| `POST` | `/admin/sizing/standards/{id}/deactivate` | Soft delete (mark inactive) |
| `POST` | `/admin/sizing/standards/{id}/reactivate` | Reactivate standard |

## üéØ **Recommended Workflow**

### **For Regular Deletion:**
1. Use the **Safe Delete** method via API
2. The system automatically handles dependent records
3. No manual database intervention needed

### **For Data Preservation:**
1. Use the **Soft Delete** method (deactivate)
2. Data remains in database but marked as inactive
3. Can be reactivated later if needed

### **For Bulk Cleanup:**
1. Use the cleanup script for multiple standards
2. Script provides safety checks and confirmation
3. Handles all dependencies automatically

## üîí **Security Features**

- **Admin Only**: All deletion methods require admin authentication
- **Audit Logging**: All operations are logged with user ID and timestamp
- **Validation**: Checks for proper permissions before any operation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## üìù **Best Practices**

1. **Always check dependencies** before deletion
2. **Use soft delete** when possible to preserve data
3. **Log all operations** for audit purposes
4. **Test in development** before production use
5. **Backup database** before major cleanup operations

## üÜò **Troubleshooting**

### **Still Getting Foreign Key Errors?**
1. Check if there are other tables with foreign keys to `sizing_standards`
2. Verify the cleanup script ran successfully
3. Check database logs for additional constraints

### **API Methods Not Working?**
1. Verify admin authentication
2. Check API routes are properly registered
3. Ensure database migrations are up to date

### **Need to Reset Everything?**
1. Use the cleanup script to remove all standards
2. Re-run the sizing standard seeder
3. Start fresh with new standards
